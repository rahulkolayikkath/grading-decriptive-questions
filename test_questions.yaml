      Step 1: Writing the sequence and identifying the AP (1 mark)
      The numbers that are divisible by 6 are 6,12,18,24 ...
      AP with a = 6, d = 6
      Step 2: Using Sum to n terms of AP.(1 Mark)
      $$S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a +(n-1)d]$$
      $$S_{40} =\frac{40}{2}[2*6 + (40-1)6$$
      $$S_{40} =20[12+39*6]$$
      $$S_{40} =20[246]$$
      $$S_{40} =4920$$
