extraction_numerical_prompt : |
  Extract and transcribe all content from this student's handwritten work using markdown with LaTeX formatting.

  **TRANSCRIPTION GUIDELINES:**

  **1. ACCURACY & FIDELITY:**
  - Read character by character for maximum accuracy
  - Preserve every mathematical error exactly as written
  - Never assume correct operations if student wrote something incorrect
  - For illegible handwriting (not math content), use context to determine unclear characters

  **2. MATHEMATICAL NOTATION:**
  - Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
  - Inline math: $expression$
  - Block equations: $$expression$$
  - Preserve student's equation numbering (e.g., if student writes "x + y = 2 -- (1)", transcribe as "Equation (1): $x + y = 2$")

  **3. STRIKE-THROUGH & CORRECTIONS:**
  - Strike-through for simplification: Show only the final simplified result
  - Completely crossed-out work: Note "[crossed out]" but transcribe visible content
  - Diagonal cancellations in fractions: Show the simplified form with a note

  **4. STRUCTURE & FLOW:**
  - Use markdown headings, bullet points for organization
  - Maintain spatial alignment and logical order
  - If student's progression jumps around, add notes like "Student's next step appears to be:"
  - Preserve step-by-step numbering as student wrote it

  **5. VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
  - For diagrams/graphs: Include description in `<figure_description></figure_description>` tags
  - Describe variables, labels, and key features shown

  **EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
  Simplifying the Expression
  $$(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)$$

  Rearranging terms to use difference of squares formula:
  $$[(x^2 + 2) + 2x][(x^2 + 2) - 2x]$$

  Applying $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
  $$= (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2$$
  $$= x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2$$
  $$= x^4 + 4$$

  **GOLDEN STANDARD SOLUTION BREAKDOWN:**
  {sample_solution_with_mark_breakdown}

  **STUDENT'S EXTRACTED ANSWER:**
  {student_answer}
  ---------------------------
  **DETAILED STEP ANALYSIS:**
  For each step of the "GOLDEN STANDARD SOLUTION BREAKDOWN" in student's work, carry out the following analysis (except for missing steps)

  **1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY CHECK:**
  - Check for correct scientific understanding and principles (ignore spelling/grammar errors)
  - Students can use alternative correct terminology or simpler expressions if they convey the right concept
  - Is the core concept understood, even if expressed differently than the golden standard?
  - Factual accuracy (specific details, measurements, units, chemical formulas - focus on scientific accuracy, not presentation)
  - Causal relationships and mechanisms (processes, sequences, interactions)

  **2. DIAGRAM AND VISUAL INTERPRETATION:(if any)**
  (If the student has included any diagrams, graphs, or visual representations, the student's extracted answer will include <figure_drawn_by_student></figure_drawn_by_student> tags)
  Using information from the <figure_drawn_by_student></figure_drawn_by_student> tags:
  Be lenient - accuracy and details in drawings are not expected, but they should be relevant, meaningful and should include expected labels.
  - Are core expectations mentioned in the GOLDEN STANDARD SOLUTION BREAKDOWN met for this step?(yes/no)

  **3. DETAILED ERROR IDENTIFICATION:(if any)**
  EXCLUDE: spelling errors, grammatical errors, capitalization errors, or diagram/visual issues (covered above)
  FOCUS ONLY ON: Scientific/conceptual errors that affect understanding
  For each conceptual error found:
  - Type of error (conceptual misunderstanding, factual inaccuracy, procedural error, etc.)
  - Specific description of the scientific misconception
  - What the correct scientific understanding should be

  Remember: Students may express understanding in various ways - focus on whether the core concept is grasped, not whether it matches the golden standard's wording or detail level.

  Provide a comprehensive analysis without assigning any scores or grades.
  Also copy the MARK DISTRIBUTION for each step from GOLDEN STANDARD SOLUTION BREAKDOWN.

  **NOTE**: If a particular step is missing, mention "Step missing in student's work" under that step's analysis.

  **DETAILED STEP ANALYSIS:** Contains point-by-point
  Step description and Max Marks for this step(X marks), followed by 
  **1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY CHECK:**
  **2. Diagram and Visual Interpretation:(if any)**
  **3. DETAILED ERROR IDENTIFICATION:**(if any)

  Here is the content analysis of student's work: 

  {content_analysis_output}

  ---------------------------
  **GRADING TASK:**
  Total Maximum Marks: {max_marks}
  1. Evaluate step-by-step:
    - Criteria: Generate concise version of step description
    - How many marks should this step receive out of X marks allocated to this step [Marks awarded[0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc.] / Max marks for the step]
    - What is the very concise version of error/correctness that we can call out against this step [ONE LINE CALLOUT of specific error if any or comment on correctness]

  2. Calculate total marks and overall feedback
    - Total Marks Awarded / Max Marks for question 
    - Concise overall feedback for the student answer

  3. Return Mark 
    - Sum of marks awarded for each step

  **GRADING GUIDELINES:**
  - NEVER penalize spelling, grammatical, or presentation errors - focus solely on scientific understanding
  - Award marks when core concepts are demonstrated, even if brief or lacking minor details
  - Think: "Does the student understand this concept?" rather than "Is this exactly like the standard?"
  - If a particular step is missing in student's work, award zero marks for that step and the callout should be "Step missing"
  - Use incremental marking: 0.5 mark increments (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc.)
  - Round marks to nearest 0.5 increment (0.8→1.0, 0.3→0.5, 0.2→0.0)
  - Be LENIENT on accuracy and details in drawings - only check if they are relevant and meaningful

  **MARKING PHILOSOPHY:**
  - Full marks: Core concept understood (regardless of detail level)
  - Partial marks: Some understanding but missing key elements  
  - Zero marks: No conceptual understanding or major misconceptions

  **FINAL VERIFICATION**
  - ONLY increments of 0.5 should be used as marks
  - Marks should NOT be deducted for spelling or grammatical errors
  - Total marks awarded: [Sum of marks received for each step]
  - Maximum marks available: {max_marks}
  - Verification: Total ≤ Maximum? [Yes/No]
  - If No, adjust marks proportionally 

  **EXAMPLE STRUCTURED OUTPUT:**
  "Criteria": [
  ["Function of ovary", "1/1", "Correctly identified the key functions of the ovary"],
  ["Function of Fallopian Tube","0.5/1","Shows understanding but missing fertilization site detail"]]
  "mark": 1.5,
  "total_points": ["1.5/2","Good understanding of reproductive system functions with minor gaps in detail"],

  Here is the content analysis of students work: 

  {content_analysis_output}
  ------------------------------
  **VALUE POINTS**(every VALUE POINT maynot apply to all problem solving)
  
  **1.FORMULATING (Setup & Problem Recognition)**
  (All aspects of FORMULATING doesnt apply to every problem solving, consider only what is applicable)
  - Did student correctly extract/identify given data?
  - Was the problem translated into appropriate mathematical language?
  - Were correct equations/formulas recalled and applied?
  - Were constraints and assumptions identified?
  
  **2.EMPLOYING (Mathematical Execution)**
  (All aspects of EMPLOYING doesnt apply to every problem solving, consider only what is applicable)
  - Were mathematical procedures executed correctly?
  - Was appropriate strategy/method selected?
  - Were calculations performed accurately?
  - Were mathematical representations used effectively?
  
  **3.INTERPRETING & EVALUATING **
  (All aspects of INTERPRETING & EVALUATING doesnt apply to every problem solving, consider only what is applicable)
  - Were intermediate results properly applied?
  - Was the final outcome of the step reasonable and contextually appropriate?
  - Was the output for the step presented in correct units/format?
  - Did student demonstrate understanding of the result's meaning?

  Task Description: 
  Based on these value points, assess the student by mentioning whether they Demonstrated Competence or Did Not Demonstrate Competence or Not Applicable for that value point
  
  GUIDELINES :
  - Demonstrated Competence: when the student have fully correctly shown the value point according to porblem solving expectations.
  - Did Not Demonstrate Competence: erros in any aspects of value point,even thoiugh the student may have shown some understanding of the value point.
  - Not Applicable: if that value point doesnt apply to this problem solving. 
  
  **EXPECTED STRUCTURED OUTPUT**:
  "formulating": "Demonstrated Competence / Did Not Demonstrate Competence / Not Applicable)"
  "employing": "Demonstrated Competence / Did Not Demonstrate Competence / Not Applicable)"
  "interpretting_evaluating": "Demonstrated Competence / Did Not Demonstrate Competence / Not Applicable)"
